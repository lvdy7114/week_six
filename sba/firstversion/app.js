/*1.Build a game of battling alien spaceships using Javascript.
Earth has been attacked by a horde of aliens! You are the captain of the USS Assembly, 
on a mission to destroy every last alien ship.
Battle the aliens as you try to destroy them with your lasers.
There are six alien ships. The aliens' weakness is that they are too logical and attack one at a time: 
they will wait to see the outcome of a battle before deploying another alien ship.
Your strength is that you have the initiative and get to attack first. However, you do not have 
targeting lasers and can only attack the aliens in order.
After you have destroyed a ship, you have the option to make a hasty retreat.
*/
//Captain of USSAssembly
//Six alien ships, captain attacks alien ships one at a time and goes first
//don't have targeting lasers and can only attack aliens in order
//After destroying an alien ship, can retreat 
//The alien waits to see the outcome of battle before deploying another alien ship 

/*2. A game round would look like this:
Captain USS attacks the first alien ship.
If the alien ship survives, the alien ship attacks uss assembly ship.
If uss captain survives, captain attacks the alien ship again.
If the Alien ship survives, the alien ship attacks uss captain ship again ... etc.
If captain uss destroys the alien ship, captain has the option to attack the next alien ship or to retreat.
If captain uss retreats, the game is over, perhaps leaving the game open for further developments or options.
If captain uss wins the game if aliens are destroyed.
If captain uss loses the game then captain uss is destroyed. what determines if he loses?

/*This version now works smoothly.  I had created a second version because at one point I kept encountering the 
program stopping at certain parts of the program.  However, the second version when six alien ships are destroyed 
it does not alert the message that they won.  So, will be submitting this one as the final work. But, feel free 
to look at my second version if you like, it's in the second version folder. 
I went back to fix this one, and now I got it to work smoothly.  
1. Tested what happens after destroying six ships. 
2. Tested what happens if player cancels or types incorrectly in prompt. 
3. Tested what happens if player decides to retreat and types no to stop playing before destroying 6 alien ships.  
4. Tested what happens if player loses. 
5. Tested what happens if player destroyed less than 6 and decides to retreat, and types yes to continue playing.
